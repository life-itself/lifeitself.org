Welcome to the Life Itself primary repo. This repo powers the LifeItself.org website.
Two main parts:

`content/` most of the content including digital notebook/garden (recommending editing in obsidian)

`/` flowershow and nextjs based webapp that creates the life itself website (mainly using content!)

lifeitself.org website using [Flowershow](https://flowershow.app/) and NextJS.

## Layout

```
/    # standard flowershow template app installed
/content       # content for the site
```

## Working on the site locally

### Make sure you have node installed

- Open terminal
- See if you have node
  ```bash
  # this result in a node prompt
  # if command not found then you do not have node
  node
  # check version >= 16
  node --version
  ```
- If you do not have node do: `brew install node`

### Install dependencies

In the `site` folder (this folder)

```
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```
npm run dev
```

You can then open the development server at http://localhost:3000
