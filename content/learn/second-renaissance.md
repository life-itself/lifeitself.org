# Second Renaissance

Our current civilization is crumbling, leading to a period of crisis and potential rebirth – what we could call a "second renaissance". There are many terms associated with it: metamodern, metacrisis, integral, teal, liminal web, gameB, regenerative and more.

The Second Renaissance initiative provides an introduction to this moment of civilization crisis and awakening — and a home for a growing community of people who are supportive of a Second Renaissance and working to make it happen.
