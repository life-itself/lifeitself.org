Sometime in the last few months, half in play and half in jest, we coined the term "Kibbuddhism" to describe what we're doing at Art / Earth / Tech â€” or what we aspire to do. The name itself hints at its meaning if you're familiar with both Kibbutz and Buddhism as it combines the two.

### What is Kibbuddhism?

For us, Kibbuddhism is a term for the idea of creating intentional communities that integrate the pragmatic utopianism of the Kibbutz with the emphasis on spiritual and inner dimension of Buddhism -- understood broadly as a stand-in for open-minded cultivation of wisdom and the inner dimension more broadly.

## What's the Kibbutz part?

A Kibbutz was (and is) an intentional, utopian community in Israel. They began in the early to mid 20th century and combined socialism with Zionism.

For us, the Kibbutz aspect of Kibbuddhism exists on several levels.

Like the Kibbutz we want to create intentional communities.

Like the Kibbutz we want to have a pragmatic, practical, doing things approach.

Like the Kibbutz there is a pioneering spirit both in ethos and in concretely realizing a utopian vision.

In the case of the Kibbutz, this vision was centered around Zionism, while for Art / Earth / Tech our focus is more on creating a radically wiser, weller world.

In the case of Kibbutz that vision was centered around Zionism and socialism, whilst for Art / Earth / Tech our focus is pragmatic utopianism for radically wiser, weller, more compassionate global society.

In summary the Kibbutz part is indicating the idea that we want to create intentional communities that integrate pragmatism, pioneering spirit, connected with a big, utopian vision.

## What's the Buddhism part?

So, the Kibbutz represents that pragmatic utopianism and what we want to add or update is a spiritual or inner dimension. Kibbutz were democratically socialist and focused on a nationalist project.

First, what we're dreaming of is a planetary project â€” one that's about transformation for all of humanity.

Second, our vision emphasizes cultivating inner capacities and wisdom. This is not necessarily tied to Buddhism specifically it is about prioritizing inner development whilst also engaging in outer action -- whilst many of us at Art / Earth / Tech Itself are inclined towards Buddhist principles we are open to wisdom from any tradition. 

So the Buddhism part of Kibbuddhism brings the emphasis on the inner and spiritual dimension as well as a more universal, planetary aspect.

## Conclusion

So, there you have it. Kibbuddhism for us is about creating intentional communities that serve as practical paths towards a radically wiser world. And that is what Art / Earth / Tech is about: Kibbuddhism in its essence and fostering Kibbuddhist communities.

## Appendix
### PS: you've got to dream big

The Kibbutz were one of the pioneering efforts in pragmatic utopianism. We hope to be another.

No delusions of grandeur here ðŸ˜‰ And dreams are important ðŸ™‚

### Why Buddhism needs the Kibbutz

The other direction of the integration: i.e. why one wants to add the Kibbutz to Buddhism. Intentional communities of Buddhism are monastic communities (as is true also of e.g. Christianity). Would like to expand from the monastic model in at least a few key ways: a) broader vision for social transformation than spiritual liberation b) material production (monasteries and monastics are often dependent on donations) c) expanding beyond monastic life e.g. allowing for families and children, a bit more secular (or at least ecumenical). Kibbutz is a natural complement / missing ingredient on each of these. E.g. Kibbutz actually have enterprises and generate resources, Kibbutz were design for groups that included families and children etc.

### Talk at Buddhafield

We're also thinking of proposing a talk at Buddhafield this year on Kibbuddhism and the question of how can we translate the utopian aspirations in religious/spiritual traditions like Buddhism into new forms that could engage more broadly and more pragmatically? That is beyond monasticism and semi-monasticism and retreat centers to daily life and daily enterprise.
