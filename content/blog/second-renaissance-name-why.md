For us, the term 'Second Renaissance' captures a powerful idea: a moment of civilizational renewal as modernity breaks down and a new paradigm emerges.[^1] We call this a 'Second Renaissance' because it reflects a time of significant change, similar to the Renaissance period in Europe.

We also appreciate this perspective may not resonate with everyone. There is a wealth of diverse voices and ideas within the broader space, and we value engagement and dialog with multiple perspectives including on this naming question. Here, we outline the reasons that led us to adopt 'Second Renaissance' as a term, recognising that it is but one framing for what is going on in the world and the responses that have been emerging within this space and beyond.

## To name, or not to name?

When we began our ecosystem mapping project at Life Itself five years ago, we encountered a linguistic challenge. When we inquired about the names or terms people used to describe this space, we were met with a mix of laughter and uncertainty. It became clear there wasn't a single, widely recognized term.

By the time of our second report in 2021, a diverse vocabulary of 5-8 different terms had emerged from our conversations: metacrisis, metamodern, integral, teal, regenerative, great turning and more.[^2] This made communication about the ecosystem difficult, both within our team and with others. The proliferation of terms created a communication barrier, especially for newcomers encountering obscure terminology like 'metamodern,' 'metacrisis,' or 'integral'.

At first, [we attempted to champion a single term](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/1501160815277318146), primarily 'metamodern,' but none resonated universally. Eventually, we resorted to the rather unappealing acronym 'PIP' (paradigmatic, integrative, and pragmatic change agents), which unsurprisingly never caught on either.

Meanwhile, we had come across usage of the term “second renaissance” in Francisco Varela's book, [Ethical Knowhow: Action, Wisdom, and Cognition](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=896). There, Varela describes the re-“discovery” of Asian philosophy and particularly Buddhism as a 'second renaissance' in Western cultural history. Independently and coincidentally, in 2022 one of our co-founders Sylvie Barbier did a [performance art piece and installation named Prophecy](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/05/24/genesis-in-three-performances). Taking place in Florence, the birthplace of the first Renaissance, the piece envisioned two possible futures: one of breakdown and decline and the other of the coming of a Second Renaissance. Following that we started to regularly use the term “Second Renaissance” and try it out with others. 

This term reflects both the historical period of transition we find ourselves in ('[a time between worlds](https://wiki.secondrenaissance.net/wiki/A_time_between_worlds)') and the movement we see arising to address the challenges of our time and steer civilization towards a flourishing future. For a more detailed explanation of how we are currently defining the Second Renaissance, read our [short introduction](https://secondrenaissance.net/).

## Why we were attracted to Second Renaissance as a term

### Accessibility to a broader audience through historical analogy

While 'Second Renaissance' may not be a common term, Western audiences at least, likely possess a baseline understanding due to a general awareness of the first Renaissance. This inherent familiarity stands in contrast to neologisms like 'metamodern' or 'metacrisis.' These concepts require significant explanation and can come across as jargon, potentially alienating those who are unfamiliar with them. 'Second Renaissance,' on the other hand, evokes a sense of societal rebirth on the scale of the Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries, making it a more straightforward term to grasp. 

### Positive framing whilst recognizing "darkness before dawn"

In addition to its clarity, we found 'Second Renaissance' has a more positive framing than some of the alternatives. While 'metacrisis' and 'polycrisis' are important concepts, they solely emphasize crisis. 'Second Renaissance' connotes rebirth, new possibilities, and a sense of hope, making it a more inspiring term to be driven by. At the same time, renaissance acknowledges the crisis and breakdown: rebirth is from something, and in the specific historical analogy, the first renaissance was preceded by the decline of the high middle ages and the terrible 14th century in famine and plague swept Europe.

### Naming a period of transition rather than end state

Another reason we liked 'Second Renaissance' is its versatility. It can naturally refer to both the transitional period we're experiencing as a civilization, and the ecosystem or social movement that aims to guide it. In addition, there are some advantages to using a name that focuses on transition and birth rather than one that focuses on the end state because end state names (e.g. metamodern, integral, teal etc) tend to attract greater contention, perhaps because there is greater attachment to specific term and its definition. We have therefore found 'Second Renaissance' helpful because it highlights the context and process of change, rather than dictating a specific destination.

## Letting go

In this short essay, we have outlined some of the reasons that drew us to the 'Second Renaissance' as a name and frame. We feel that it is relatively familiar for Western audiences, has some immediate meaning for wider audiences, carries a hopeful connotation, and highlights the process of transformation and renewal.

Overall, we believe common terminology would be helpful and necessary as we seek a wider audience for these ideas and approaches. And whilst we see the attraction of this particular term, our real commitment lies with the core principles and values that define the vision and movement that we aspire to cultivate, regardless of how it is named. Specifically, if a different framing or terminology better serves these principles, we welcome its emergence.
