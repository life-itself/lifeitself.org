## Description

Collective Activism is an initiative started by Life Itself to explore how we can bring contemplative awareness, skills and practices into activism and social leadership. Wisdom and awakening will be increasingly important if we are to successfully respond and adapt to the deepening ecological crisis we are facing.

Contemplative Activism is the realisation that one of the wellsprings of our social and personal pain and confusion is the lack of a contemplative mindset -- the mindset we are in when we are "connected." Contemplative activism means doing the activism that we already do, such as climate activism, with a contemplative or reflective mindset. It also involves asking ourselves how to be activist on behalf of the contemplative mindset -- to give our wholeness its central place in our lives, organisations, and in society.

We see many expressions of contemplative pursuits such as mindfulness, embodied movement, and trauma healing to name a few. We are collectively exploring contemplative pursuits' of intertwinedness, and co-creating a space for these related pursuits to make each other more whole and more effective.
