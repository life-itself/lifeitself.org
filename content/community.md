## What is the Life Itself Community?

Welcome to our digital village! Just like a traditional village, we are a diverse community encompassing multiple generations, various backgrounds, professions, and skills. The Life Itself community is for:

1.  👥 Connection - Through the community chat we hope to connect deeply together and develop new relationships. Most importantly we encourage openness for a diversity of perspectives and connecting with people who think and do differently and yet aspire to the same need for change. 
2.  💯 Collaboration - Within connection, opens a creative space for collaboration between community members. This could be in the form of participating in an event, joining an organization, or simply creating ideas together. 
3.  📚Education - This is a space for information sharing, skill sharing and knowledge development. We will carry out group discussions led by researchers, academicians, and industry experts. These discussions can be led by the community members as well; reach out to the admins to suggest your topic and schedule your group discussion.
4.  💫 Support - To foster mutual support between community members, whatever that might be. This is a space of encouragement, hope, and possibility.

### Second Renaissance calls

The Life Itself Community Calendar includes the [Second Renaissance Calendar](https://lu.ma/second-renaissance), including biweekly Workspace calls and Connection calls on alternate Tuesdays. These are for connecting and getting involved in projects associated with our [Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/) initiative.

### Research calls

Research calls currently happen on Fridays. These are for people interested in digging deeper into the ideas driving Life Itself [initiatives](https://lifeitself.org/initiatives) and especially exploring paths towards a [Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/). They take a variety of forms, but often involve sharing the results of research on specific areas in a seminar format. If you think you might be a fit for the [Life Itself Research](https://lifeitself.org/research) community, attending one of these calls is a great first step.

Recordings and outputs of previous Research calls are available on the Research channel of our newsletter [here](https://news.lifeitself.org/s/research):


### Get Involved calls

Get involved calls are open to anyone who wants to contribute to the basic operations of Life Itself. This includes things like the newsletter, organising meetings, and updating the website.

## Ground Rules

The following invitations are shared to make this space a collaborative and accessible place for all. For the most part, these are simple common sense. If you show up with the purpose of collaboration, connection, education, and contribution the rest will simply occur organically. 

1. Respect each other: Treat other members of the group with respect and kindness. Avoid using abusive or derogatory language towards anyone.
2. Keep it clean: Refrain from sharing any inappropriate content like sexually explicit messages or images, vulgar jokes, hate speech, etc.
3. Respect others boundaries: Communicating your boundaries and being aware of others boundaries will help maintain a good nature within the group, while making everyone feel safe. For example, if you want to reach out privately to someone in the group, ask for their permission publicly first.
4. Self-promotion, but not too much: We’re excited to hear what you are up to if it makes sense to share it in the group. However, remember this is a space for everyone, so keep self-promotion to a reasonable frequency. 
5. Confidentiality: Do not share any personal or sensitive information about other members of the group without their consent.
6. Be responsible: Take responsibility for your actions and the messages you share in the group. If you notice any violation of the guidelines, report it to the group admin immediately.
7. Listen to others and respect each other's opinions: Pay attention to what others are saying and show interest in their opinions. Do not interrupt or talk over others, and be open to hearing different points of view even if you disagree.
8. Be courteous: Say "please" and "thank you" when appropriate, and be polite in your interactions with others.
9. Avoid personal attacks: Do not attack or insult other group members based on their race, gender, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Disagreements should be handled respectfully and without attacking the person.
10. Stay on topic: Keep the conversations on-topic and relevant to the purpose of the group. Avoid sharing unrelated messages or spamming the group with unnecessary messages.
11. Be concise: Keep the conversation focused on the topic at hand and avoid going off on tangents. This helps to keep the discussion productive and respectful.
12. Share helpful content: Share content that is helpful or interesting to the group members. This could be news articles, memes, jokes, or anything else that adds value to the group.
13. Be active: Participate in the group regularly by sharing your thoughts and ideas. This helps to keep the conversation lively and engaging.

By following these ground rules, we can create a safe and respectful community where everyone can freely express their opinions and ideas without any fear of judgment or harassment.
